# Utils

This is a folder containg two utility files: (1) build_data.py and (2) make_density_gif.py

build_data.py is the code required to tokenize the queries and limit them to the first sentence.

make_density_gif.py is the code that builds a gif visualizing the actions/cumulative distribution function of the predictions and observed rewards during training.
